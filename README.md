## Specs

Describe Solar-age
  test 'create objects using the constructor'
    expect(age.name).toEqual();
    expect(age.userLifeEx).toEqual(100);
    expect(age.userAge).toEqual();
    expect(age.planetTime).toEqual([]);
  
    
  test('create a function to run age calculation', () => {
    expect(age.yearsLeft());
  
    
  test('build life span object ', () => {
    expect(age.mercuryLifeSpan());
    expect(age.venusLifeSpan());
    expect(age.marsLifeSpan());
    expect(age.jupiterLifeSpan());
